  title: SendGrid Patch Mail Settings Address Whitelist
  description: |-
    **This endpoint allows you to update your current email address whitelist settings.**

    The address whitelist setting whitelists a specified email address or domain for which mail should never be suppressed. For example, you own the domain ???example.com,??? and one or more of your recipients use email@example.com addresses, by placing example.com in the address whitelist setting, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain will be ignored and sent as if under normal sending conditions.

    Mail settings allow you to tell SendGrid specific things to do to every email that you send to your recipients over SendGrid???s [Web API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html) or [SMTP Relay](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/index.html).

      description: |-
        **This endpoint allows you to remove an IP address from warmup mode.**

        SendGrid can automatically warm up dedicated IP addresses by limiting the amount of mail that can be sent through them per hour, with the limit determined by how long the IP address has been in warmup. See the [warmup schedule](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_warmup_schedule.html) for more details on how SendGrid limits your email traffic for IPs in warmup.

        For more general information about warming up IPs, please see our [Classroom](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Deliver/Delivery_Introduction/warming_up_ips.html).

        **This endpoint allows you to see which IP pools a particular IP address has been added to.**

        The same IP address can be added to multiple IP pools.

        A single IP address or a range of IP addresses may be dedicated to an account in order to send email for multiple domains. The reputation of this IP is based on the aggregate performance of all the senders who use it.
