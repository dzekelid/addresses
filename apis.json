In 1999, it became one of the first to set up a free online directory enquiries service - ukphonebook.com.Building on the popularity of ukphonebook.com, Corporate ukphonebook.com was created as a dedicated business service in 2000. It now supplies customers including Merseyside Police and Yorkshire Building Society with access to telephone and address information as well as the UK Electoral Roll.Further developments came in 2002 in response to the deregulation of voice directory enquiries services with the switch from the old access code to a range of competing services under the code 118xxx. Simunix took part in the high-profile number allocation lottery and chose 118080, 118365 and 118090 (for international directory enquiries). 118-Express was created at this time to coincide with the changes occurring in the industry sector.Most recent projects have included the development of TPS Manage, a TPS/CTPS check facility, and T2A, a powerful API for finding, validating and verifying data.Simunix now supplies its range of directory products and services to most private and public sectors including, police, banking, legal, local authorities and many more.",

Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Internet.With Snowball, you don&rsquo;t need to write any code or purchase any hardware to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS Management Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball client to establish a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories that you want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and you can track the job status viaAmazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text messages, or directly in the Console.Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.",
